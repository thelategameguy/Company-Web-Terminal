Welcome to 'The Company', a venture where opportunity meets profitability. 

Are you ready for a unique experience? Ready to explore new locations and embark on a journey that could lead to substantial profits? 'The Company' offers you this opportunity. Sign a contract with us, and we'll transport you to a new location where you'll stay for the duration of the contract. 

Your mission? Collect scrap. It's a simple task with a significant reward. But here's the catch - we have a weekly quota that you need to meet. The more you collect, the more you earn. The scrap you collect will be sold, turning waste into wealth. 

And the best part? That wealth is yours to keep at the end of the contract. We're talking about large amounts of profit that could change your life. 

Join 'The Company'. Explore. Collect. Meet your quota. Profit. With us, every scrap counts, and every quota met means more money in your pocket.
